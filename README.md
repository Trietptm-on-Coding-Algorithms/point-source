Point-source Decompiler
=======================

Point-source is a pure Python implementation of a C Decompiler.
It works on top of well-known disassemblers (i.e. IDA Pro) and makes use of LLVM
IR (through LLVMlite project) to represent multi-platform assembly code into a
common language before converting it to the appropriate C-language
representation.

Supported platforms:

* [?] PowerPC
* [-] MIPS
* [-] x86
* [-] x86-64
* [-] ARM
* [-] AArch64
